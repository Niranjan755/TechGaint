            <h2>The New IT Rules:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>As per the IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, “Social media is welcome to do business in India… they have got good business. They have got a good number of users and also empowered ordinary Indians. But users must also be given a proper forum for the resolution of their grievances in a time-bound manner against abuse and misuse of social media.”                </li>
                <li>As per the Government, the rules will come into effect the day they are notified for most applicable entities,</li>
                <li>An extra three-month window is provided for ‘significant social media intermediaries’, which are a separate category of companies. They have a greater compliance burden.</li>
                <li>The significant social media intermediary (those who provide services primarily like messaging like WhatsApp) need to enable the identification of the “first originator” of the information that has been transferred using their platform. This move would help track fake news creators.</li>
                <li>As stated in the Government notification, “Significant social media intermediaries providing services primarily like messaging shall enable identification of the first originator of the information that is required only for the purposes of prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of an offence related to sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states, or public order or of incitement to an offence relating to the above or in relation with rape, sexually explicit material or child sexual abuse material punishable with imprisonment for a term of not less than five years.”</li>
                <li>The social media company would need to hire three employees, who would be residents of India to deal with the grievances of the users</li>
                <li>Among these would be a Chief Compliance Officer, who would ensure compliance with rules. It would be followed by a nodal person of contact for coordination with law enforcement agencies.</li>
                <li>The last would be the resident grievance officer who would take care of all functions together</li>
                <li>Also, the Code of Ethics and Procedure and Safeguards concerning Digital/Online Media has been introduced this time</li>
                <li>The rules also hold valid for various platforms ranging from online news and digital media entities to OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime.</li>
                <li>The Publishers would need to observe “Norms of Journalistic Conduct of the Press Council of India and the Programme Code under the Cable Television Networks Regulation Act”</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h2>Grievance Redressal System under the Act:</h2>
            <p>Level 1 would be self-regulation by an applicable entity, which needs to appoint a grievance redressal officer based in India.</p>
