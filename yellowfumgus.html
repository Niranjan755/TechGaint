            <h2>What is Yellow Fungus disease?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Like black fungus and white fungus, yellow fungus too is a fungal infection, but it can be rather fatal and deadly as 
                it begins internally â€” unlike the others where symptoms are visible. ANI quoted Dr Tyagi as saying that this yellow 
                fungus trait often leads to a delay in its diagnosis. This characteristic of yellow fungus makes it very difficult 
                to manage and more dangerous as early diagnosis is a necessity in such cases.</p>

            <h2>Yellow Fungus Symptoms:</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Symptoms of yellow fungus are loss of appetite, lethargy and weight loss. In latter stages of the infection 
                patients suffering from yellow fungus exhibit severe symptoms sunken eyes due to malnutrition and organ failure,
                 slow healing of wounds and oozing of pus from the wounds, and necrosis (cell injury that leads to death of cells 
                 and living tissues.</p>

            <h2>Yellow Fungus Treatment:</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Like mucormycosis, the treatment for yellow fungus is Amphoteracin-B injection, Dr Tyagi said.</p>

            <h2>Yellow Fungus Precautions:</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Here are some of the precautions that one can take to protect themselves from the yellow fungus:
                <ol>
                    <li>Keep your room, home and surroundings as clean as possible;</li>
                    <li>Remove stale food and fecal matter immediately to check bacteria and fungal growth;</li>
                    <li>Keep the humidity of the room and home under check as excessive humidity promotes bacteria growth. Just like for Covid patients maintaining clean air flow inside the room and homes is necessary.</li>
                    <li>Coronavirus positive patients must immediately start treatment so complications like yellow fungus do not develop.</li>
                </ol>
